#include <iostream>

int a, b = 5; // These are global variables
// Global variable memories are statically managed by the compiler
// They are allocated in the data segment of the memory
// Once the prgogram ends, their memory is freed

// Local varibles are only available inside the scope
// After execution they are deleted
// Called Automatic Variables, managed by the compilers
// Allocated in the stack segment of the memory
